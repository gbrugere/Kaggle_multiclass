![](https://github.com/gbrugere/Kaggle_multiclass/blob/main/header.png)
## Overview
The goal of this competition is to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using the accuracy score.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
